# validation-lab

Validation is very important and will help you identify errors in your work. All of the assignments that you submit for this course must be valid HTML. Invalid HTML will result in a significantly lower score on the assignment.  Make sure that you validate all of you work before turning it in.  

Information on HTML Validation is found in your textbook.

Please use the [W3C HTML Validator](https://html5.validator.nu/) to validate your files.  This is what will be used when grading assignments.
